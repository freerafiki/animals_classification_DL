# animals classification (deep learning)
This will be the repository for the course project for the Deep Learning course

## Participation
Participation is expected from all of you. We will build the dataset together and then have some coding session where a group (possibly every time different)
will work through the code. It is a common experiment.

## Dataset
We create a dataset for animal classification.
Each participant will pick an animal and help gathering images of that animal.

We want to train a neural network to learn to classify these animals, so we need many images of them!

### Images
Images should:
- have an acceptable quality and resolution (around 500x500 is also ok, not lower). Having much larger resolution will create a dataset which will be too heavy for our purposes, so please stick to medium resolution images.
- be royalty free or have a license which permit their use for educational projects. You can find a lot of suitable images on [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and similar websites.
- show the animal they belong to. Only one type of animal should be present in the image (at least for this project), more than one of the same type of animal is accepted.
- be different, so the network can recognize the animal, avoid having all images that look the same.

#### Storage
For the moment just create a folder on your computer, from next week we discuss how to gather all of the images together.

### Animals
Each participant should write here below the animals of which they are responsible for.
Please do not pick animals that are too similar to each other, try not to choose different breeds of the same animal, bur rather different animals.

- **Tiger**: Mariana
- **Fox**: Julien
